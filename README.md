NoClutter is an all in one tweak dedicated to hiding all the annoyances of iOS. It replaces all those "no" tweaks, like "NoBreadcrumbs" or "NoHomebar".

It is available on Twickd [here](https://repo.twickd.com/package/com.twickd.quix.noclutter). 

This is my first and only tweak. I don't recommend learning tweak development from this tweak, as I barely know what im doing.
